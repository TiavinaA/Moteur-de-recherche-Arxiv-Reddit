I  downloaded data from the Environmental Protection Agency ([https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/smart-location-database1](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/smart-location-database1))  and did some simple coding on R to figure out the average Walkability  Index Score per FIPS county code. Word of warning, I simply summed up  all the entries that matched the FIPS county code and divided by the  number of US Census Block Group 12 Digit FIPS code entries found inside  that county, which may offer some interesting results in counties with a  lot of 12 digit code entries and in counties with very few.

However, to date networks in geographyhave been primarily explored either through actor-network theory or assemblagethinking, both of which embrace the network metaphor without specifically andformally interrogating networks themselves. We seek to problematize thetreatment of networks in geography by exploring the largely underutilizedliterature on social networks as an alternative to the now dominantactor-network and assemblage frameworks. Our paper discusses the conceptualconnections between key concepts in geography, such as place, distance, scale,and power, and those in network theory, such as centrality, density, andhomophily.

We generalize the techniques which compare the geography of surfaces withthe geography of arrangements of curves via asymptotic constructions.

Lagrangian geography of the deep Gulf of Mexico,P Miron,2018/04/18,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06843v1,"Using trajectories from acoustically tracked (RAFOS) floats in the Gulf ofMexico, we construct a geography of its Lagrangian circulation within the1500--2500-m layer. This is done by building a Markov-chain representation ofthe Lagrangian dynamics. The geography is composed of weakly interactingprovinces that constrain the connectivity at depth. The main geography includestwo provinces of near equal areas and separated by a roughly meridionalboundary. The residence time is about 4.5 (3.5) years in the western (eastern)province. The exchange between these provinces is effected through a slowcyclonic circulation, which is well constrained in the western basin bypreservation of $f/H$, where $f$ is the Coriolis parameter and $H$ is depth.Secondary provinces of varied shapes covering smaller areas are identified withresidence times ranging from about 0.4 to 1.2 years or so. Except for the mainprovinces, the deep Lagrangian geography does not resemble the surfaceLagrangian geography recently inferred from satellite-tracked driftertrajectories. This implies disparate connectivity characteristics withpotential implications for pollutant (e.g., oil) dispersal at the surface anddepth. A ventilation conduit through the southeastern corner of the domain fromthe Caribbean Sea balanced by weak vertical exchange is also inferred. This issupported by the inspection of satellite-tracked profiling (Argo) floats,which, while forming a smaller dataset and having seemingly differentwater-following characteristics than the RAFOS floats, replicate the mainaspects of the Lagrangian geography. Finally, consistency with independentresults from a chemical tracer release experiment is found to provideadditional support to the results.",Arxiv,

We argue that standardtechniques for detecting overlapping clusters and communities are not able tocapture this type of structure, and show how robust regression techniques caninstead be used to remove the influence of both sector and geography from thecorrelation matrix separately.

Geographical Modeling: from Characteristic Scale to Scaling,Yanguang Chen,2020/01/28,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10323v1,"Geographical research was successfully quantified through the quantitativerevolution of geography.

The largest obstacle of geography'stheorization lies in scale-free distributions of geographical phenomena whichexist everywhere. The first paradigm of scientific research is mathematicaltheory. The key of a quantitative measurement and mathematical modeling is tofind a valid characteristic scale. Unfortunately, for many geographicalsystems, there is no characteristic scale. In this case, the method of scalingshould be employed to make a spatial measurement and carry out mathematicalmodeling. The basic idea of scaling is to find a power exponent using thedouble logarithmic linear relation between a variable scale and thecorresponding measurement results. The exponent is a characteristic parameterwhich follows a scaleful distribution and can be used to characterize thescale-free phenomena.

Winning the War by (Strategically) Losing Battles: Settling the  Complexity of Grundy-Values in Undirected Geography,Kyle Burke,2021/06/03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02114v1,"We settle two long-standing complexity-theoretical questions-open since 1981and 1993-in combinatorial game theory (CGT).  We prove that the Grundy value (a.k.a. nim-value, or nimber) of UndirectedGeography is PSPACE-complete to compute. This exhibits a stark contrast with aresult from 1993 that Undirected Geography is polynomial-time solvable. Bydistilling to a simple reduction, our proof further establishes a dichotomytheorem, providing a ""phase transition to intractability"" in Grundy-valuecomputation, sharply characterized by a maximum degree of four: The Grundyvalue of Undirected Geography over any degree-three graph is polynomial-timecomputable, but over degree-four graphs-even when planar and bipartite-isPSPACE-hard. Additionally, we show, for the first time, how to constructUndirected Geography instances with Grundy value $\ast n$ and size polynomialin n.  We strengthen a result from 1981 showing that sums of tractable partisangames are PSPACE-complete in two fundamental ways. First, since UndirectedGeography is an impartial ruleset, we extend the hardness of sums to impartialgames, a strict subset of partisan. Second, the 1981 construction is not builtfrom a natural ruleset, instead using a long sum of tailored short-depth gamepositions. We use the sum of two Undirected Geography positions to create ourhard instances. Our result also has computational implications toSprague-Grundy Theory (1930s) which shows that the Grundy value of thedisjunctive sum of any two impartial games can be computed-in polynomialtime-from their Grundy values. In contrast, we prove that assuming PSPACE$\neq$ P, there is no general polynomial-time method to summarize twopolynomial-time solvable impartial games to efficiently solve their disjunctivesum.",Arxiv,

Larval dispersal of intertidal organisms and the influence of coastline  geography,Thomas P. Adams,2013/04/23,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6319v2,"The dispersal stages of organisms with sessile adults must be able to selecthabitats with suitable conditions for establishment and survival, and must alsobe able to reach those locations. For marine planktonic larvae, movement due tocurrents is often orders of magnitude greater than movement due to swimmingbehaviour, so transport is largely passive.  Current patterns are determined by the interaction of geography with tidalforces, modified by meteorological conditions. These linkages impose anarea-specific focus to connectivity studies. Yet, how geographical features andmeteorological forcing combine to produce specific current patterns andresultant connectivity among populations remains unclear.  In this study, we followed tracks of generic particles driven by modelledhydrodynamic currents to investigate how connectivity between evenly spacedhabitat sites varies in relation to coastal topography. Larvae released fromregions of high current velocity, open coastline and low local habitatavailability travelled furthest but were less likely to disperse successfully.Extensive natal habitat in the vicinity of a site generally had a positiveimpact on the number of larvae arriving, as did low current velocities.However, relationships between numbers of arriving larvae and localgeographical indices were complex, particularly at longer larval durations.  Local geography alone explained up to 50% of the variance in success oflarvae released and around 10% of the variation in the number of larvaearriving at each site, but coastline properties fall short of predictingdispersal measures for particular locations. The study shows thatmeteorological variation and broad scale current patterns interact stronglywith local geography to determine connectivity in coastal areas.",Arxiv,

Bayesian Dynamic Mapping of an Exo-Earth from Photometric Variability,Hajime Kawahara,2020/07/26,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13096v1,"Photometric variability of a directly imaged exo-Earth conveys spatialinformation on its surface and can be used to retrieve a two-dimensionalgeography and axial tilt of the planet (spin-orbit tomography). In this study,we relax the assumption of the static geography and present a computationallytractable framework for dynamic spin-orbit tomography applicable to thetime-varying geography. First, a Bayesian framework of static spin-orbittomography is revisited using analytic expressions of the Bayesian inverseproblem with a Gaussian prior. We then extend this analytic framework to atime-varying one through a Gaussian process in time domain, and presentanalytic expressions that enable efficient sampling from a full joint posteriordistribution of geography, axial tilt, spin rotation period, andhyperparameters in the Gaussian-process priors. Consequently, it only takes 0.3s for a laptop computer to sample one posterior dynamic map conditioned on theother parameters with 3,072 pixels and 1,024 time grids, for a total of $\sim 3\times 10^6$ parameters. We applied our dynamic mapping method on a toy modeland found that the time-varying geography was accurately retrieved along withthe axial-tilt and spin rotation period.

Geography as a Science of the Earth's Surface Founded on the Third View  of Space,Bin Jiang,2021/08/05,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02493v2,"The third (or organismic) view of space states that space is neither lifelessnor neutral, but a living structure capable of being more living or lessliving, thus different fundamentally from the first two mechanistic views ofspace: Newtonian absolute space and Leibnizian relational space.

This paper seeks to lay out a new geography as ascience of the Earth's surface founded on the third view of space. The newgeography aims not only to better understand geographic forms and processes butalso - maybe more importantly - to make geographic space or the Earth's surfaceto be living or more living. After introducing two fundamental laws ofgeography: Tobler's law on spatial dependence (or homogeneity) and scaling lawon spatial heterogeneity, we argue that these two laws are fundamental laws ofliving structure that favor statistics over exactitude, because the former (orstatistics) tends to make a structure more living than the latter (orexactitute). We present the concept of living structure through some workingexamples and make it clear how a living structure differs from a non-livingstructure, under the organismic worldview that was first conceived by theBritish philosopher Alfred Whitehead (1861-1947). In order to make a structureor space living or more living, we introduce two design principles -differentiation and adaptation - using two paintings and two city plans.

Cloud ArcGIS Online as an innovative tool for developing geoinformation  competence with future geography teachers,Ihor Kholoshyn,2019/09/10,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04388v1,"The article dwells upon the scientifically relevant problem of usingcloud-based GIS-technologies when training future geography teachers (based onArcGIS Online application). The authors outline the basic principles forimplementing ArcGIS Online in the educational process (interdisciplinaryintegration, the sequence of individualization in training, communicability,distance education and regional studies), and provide an example of aninteractive map created with the help of the specified cloud GIS, since thiskind of map is the most popular a form of research by geography students. Inthe article it is noted that integration of ArcGIS Online into the educationalprocess allows the teacher to follow a clear pedagogical strategy, taking intoaccount possible variants of its use (demonstration, direct mastering of GIS ina computer class and independent work in an individual mode). Considering cloudGIS as a new stage in the development of geoinformational education, theauthors emphasize their key benefits (round-the-clock access, work with GISpackage in the cloud, the ability to use other maps as well as the creation oftheir own maps and webapplications) and disadvantages (monetization ofservices, underestimation of the GIS role in the curriculum of the higherschool, the lack of Ukrainian content, etc.).",Arxiv,
ERNIE-GeoL: A Geography-and-Language Pre-trained Model and its  Applications in Baidu Maps,Jizhou Huang,2022/03/17,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09127v3,"Pre-trained models (PTMs) have become a fundamental backbone for downstreamtasks in natural language processing and computer vision. Despite initial gainsthat were obtained by applying generic PTMs to geo-related tasks at Baidu Maps,a clear performance plateau over time was observed. One of the main reasons forthis plateau is the lack of readily available geographic knowledge in genericPTMs. To address this problem, in this paper, we present ERNIE-GeoL, which is ageography-and-language pre-trained model designed and developed for improvingthe geo-related tasks at Baidu Maps. ERNIE-GeoL is elaborately designed tolearn a universal representation of geography-language by pre-training onlarge-scale data generated from a heterogeneous graph that contains abundantgeographic knowledge. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experimentsconducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority andeffectiveness of ERNIE-GeoL. ERNIE-GeoL has already been deployed in productionat Baidu Maps since April 2021, which significantly benefits the performance ofvarious downstream tasks. This demonstrates that ERNIE-GeoL can serve as afundamental backbone for a wide range of geo-related tasks.",Arxiv,
Impact of geography on the importance of parameters in infectious  disease models,Arindam Saha,2023/10/03,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02449v2,"Agent-based models are widely used to predict infectious disease spread. Forthese predictions, one needs to understand how each input parameter affects theresult. Here, some parameters may affect the sensitivities of others, requiringthe analysis of higher order coefficients through e.g. Sobol sensitivityanalysis. The geographical structures of real-world regions are distinct inthat they are difficult to reduce to single parameter values, making a unifiedsensitivity analysis intractable. Yet analyzing the importance of geographicalstructure on the sensitivity of other input parameters is important because astrong effect would justify the use of models with real-world geographicalrepresentations, as opposed to stylized ones.  Here we perform a grouped Sobol's sensitivity analysis on COVID-19 spreadsimulations across a set of three diverse real-world geographicalrepresentations. We study the differences in both results and the sensitivityof non-geographical parameters across these geographies. By comparing Sobolindices of parameters across geographies, we find evidence that infection ratecould have more sensitivity in regions where the population is segregated,while parameters like recovery period of mild cases are more sensitive inregions with mixed populations. We also show how geographical structure affectsparameter sensitivity changes over time.",Arxiv,

This is different from the p_c=0 foralpha<3 results for well-mixed scale-free networks. In our lattice-basedscale-free network, individuals link to nearby neighbors on a lattice. Evenconsiderable additional small-world links do not change our conclusion ofnonzero thresholds. When applied to disease propagation, these results suggestthat random immunization may be more successful in controlling human epidemicsthan previously suggested if there is geographical clustering.",Arxiv,
A Geographic Directed Preferential Internet Topology Model,Sagy Bar,2005/02/14,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0502061v1,"The goal of this work is to model the peering arrangements between AutonomousSystems (ASes). Most existing models of the AS-graph assume an undirectedgraph. However, peering arrangements are mostly asymmetric Customer-Providerarrangements, which are better modeled as directed edges. Furthermore, it iswell known that the AS-graph, and in particular its clustering structure, isinfluenced by geography.  We introduce a new model that describes the AS-graph as a directed graph,with an edge going from the customer to the provider, but also models symmetricpeer-to-peer arrangements, and takes geography into account. We are able tomathematically analyze its power-law exponent and number of leaves. Beyond theanalysis we have implemented our model as a synthetic network generator we callGdTang. Experimentation with GdTang shows that the networks it produces aremore realistic than those generated by other network generators, in terms ofits power-law exponent, fractions of customer-provider and symmetric peeringarrangements, and the size of its dense core. We believe that our model is thefirst to manifest realistic regional dense cores that have a clear geographicflavor. Our synthetic networks also exhibit path inflation effects that aresimilar to those observed in the real AS graph.",Arxiv,

To investigate the spatial distribution of computer scienceresearch centres in the United States, we compute the two-point correlationfunction of the spatial point process and show that the observed power-laws donot disappear even when we change the physical representation from geographicalspace to cartogram space. Our work suggests that the effect of physicallocation poses a challenge to ongoing efforts to develop realistic models ofscientific productivity.

Then, is it possible to see howKant played a role in Einstein's thinking without reading Kant's books? Thisquestion arises because it is not possible for physicists to read Kant'swritings. Yes, it is possible if we use the method of physics. It is known alsothat Kant's mode of thinking was profoundly affected by the geography ofKoenigsberg where he spent eighty years of entire life. We examine what aspectof this geography led Kant to create his philosophy upon which Einstein'sconcept of relativity was based. It is pointed out that the Eastern philosophyof Taoism is a product of the geographical environment similar to that ofKant's Koenigsberg, and therefore that Kantianism is strikingly similar toTaoism.",Arxiv,
Impacts of preference and geography on epidemic spreading,Xin-Jian Xu,2007/10/21,http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3907v1,"We investigate the standard susceptible-infected-susceptible model on arandom network to study the effects of preference and geography on diseasesspreading. The network grows by introducing one random node with $m$ links on aEuclidean space at unit time. The probability of a new node $i$ linking to anode $j$ with degree $k_j$ at distance $d_{ij}$ from node $i$ is proportionalto $k_{j}^{A}/d_{ij}^{B}$, where $A$ and $B$ are positive constants governingpreferential attachment and the cost of the node-node distance. In the case ofA=0, we recover the usual epidemic behavior with a critical threshold belowwhich diseases eventually die out. Whereas for B=0, the critical behavior isabsent only in the condition A=1. While both ingredients are proposedsimultaneously, the network becomes robust to infection for larger $A$ andsmaller $B$.",Arxiv,

Language and culture are intimatelyconnected and linguists often use distinctive keywords to quantify the dynamicsof information spreading in societies harbouring strong culture centres. Oneprominent example, which is addressed here, is Kyoto's historical impact onJapanese culture. We construct a first minimal model, based on sharedproperties of linguistic maps, to address the interplay between informationflow and geography. In particular, we show that spreading of information overJapan in the pre-modern time can be described as a Eden growth process, withnoise levels corresponding to coherent spatial patches of sizes given by asingle days walk, and with patch-to-patch communication time comparable to thetime between human generations.",Arxiv,
On the Spaces and Dimensions of Geographical Systems,Yanguang Chen,2011/05/25,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.4982v2,"To remove the confusion of concepts about different sorts of geographicalspace and dimension, a new framework of space theory is proposed in this paper.Based on three sets of fractal dimensions, the geographical space is dividedinto three types: real space (R-space), phase space (P-space), and order space(O-space). The real space is concrete or visual space, the fractal dimension ofwhich can be evaluated through digital maps or remotely sensed images. Thephase space and order space are both abstract space, the fractal dimensionvalues of which cannot be estimated with one or two maps or images. Thedimension of phase space can be computed by using time series, and that oforder space can be determined with cross-sectional data in certain time. Threeexamples are offered to illustrate the three types of spaces and fractaldimension of geographical systems. The new space theory can be employed toexplain the parameters of geographical scaling laws, such as the scalingexponent of the allometric growth law of cities and the fractal dimension basedon Horton's laws of rivers.",Arxiv,
